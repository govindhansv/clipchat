# Project Description
ClipChat is an AI-powered chat application that responds to user messages with relevant film clips and GIFs. The bot uses semantic matching to find the perfect movie clips that match the conversation context, creating an interactive and entertaining chat experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who needs a regular chat bot when you can have one that responds with movie clips? Normal conversations are boring - we need cinematic responses that bring every chat to life with the perfect film moment!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI chat bot that doesn't just talk back - it responds with carefully curated film clips and GIFs that match your conversation. Using semantic matching and Giphy's vast collection, every response becomes a mini movie moment!
